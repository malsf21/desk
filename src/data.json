				"wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice:_What%27s_the_Right_Thing_to_Do%3F",
				"description": "Justice is one of my favourite political philosophy books - Michael Sandel gives a great introduction to the large history of political philosophy, ranging from the works of Aristotle to Kant to Rawls, but also delves deeply into each (seemingly) competing philosphy and ties it to problems in the status quo."
