blurb: "In one of the most iconic books of all time, George Orwell paints a picture of a dystopian future with an almost omniscient and omnipresent government. The Orwellian state that he conjures has striking parallels with governments of past and present; 1984 is as good of political thriller as it is a warning sign about our future."
