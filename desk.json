			"title": "Justice",
			"long-title": "Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?",
			"author": "Michael Sandel",
			"fiction": false,
			"genre": "Political Philosophy",
			"amazon": "http://a.co/d/8ztiNnP",
			"wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice:_What%27s_the_Right_Thing_to_Do%3F",
			"description": "Justice is one of my favourite political philosophy books - Michael Sandel simutaneously gives a great introduction to the large history of political philosophy, ranging from the works of Aristotle to Kant to Rawls, but also delves deeply into each (seemingly) competing philosphy and ties it to problems in the status quo."

			"author": "Hans Rosling",

			"wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness:_Ten_Reasons_We%27re_Wrong_About_the_World--and_Why_Things_Are_Better_Than_You_Think",
			"description": "Factfulness is a welcome and optimistic return to reality in a world of doom, gloom, and misinformation. Hans Rosling (and his team) describes the astounding improvements in global health and freedom that humankind has made in the last century, while cementing the need for continued action."

			"wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind",

			"author": "Jim Al-Khalili",
			"fiction": false,
			"genre": "Physics",
			"amazon": "http://a.co/d/b086I4q",
			"description": "In Paradox, Jim Al-Khalili playfully explores nine seemingly paradoxical problems, unravelling each of them with a toolkit of basic logic, math, and eventually, relativistic physics. It's a rare breed of book that engages complex ideas, keeps the reader intellectually stimulated, and is genuinely a fun read."
