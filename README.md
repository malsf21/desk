Desk is a small React-based web app that displays some information about myself (currently, my favourite books and albums). I'm planning on adding more information soon, and switching up the design!

Desk uses React, [react-fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome), and [Liteweight](https://github.com/malsf21/liteweight).
