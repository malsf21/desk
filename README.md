# desk

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/malsf21/desk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/malsf21/desk)

Desk is a small React-based web app that displays some information about myself (currently, my favourite books and albums). I'm planning on adding more information soon, and switching up the design!

Desk uses [React](https://reactjs.org), [react-fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome), and [Liteweight](https://github.com/malsf21/liteweight).

Desk gets all of its information from `src/data.json`. Eventually, the goal is to make desk modular enough that anybody can make their own desk - however, a lot more work is needed before that's possible.
